# Project: Toxic Comments Classification
Business Problem: We are given large number of Wikipedia comments which have been labeled by human raters for toxic behavior.
The types of toxicity are: `toxic`, `severe_toxic`, `obscene`, `threat`, `insult`, `identity_hate`.
We should create a model which predicts a probability of each type of toxicity for each comment.
